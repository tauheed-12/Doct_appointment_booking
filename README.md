A website where a person can book a slot to consult with a specific doctor is developed, utilizing React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. 
Upon clicking on a particular doctor, the website displays information about that doctor on a dedicated page. From there, individuals can book their slots for consultation. After booking a slot, 
an email is sent to the doctor's email address, which is stored in the database. 
The email contains details about the patient, such as their name, preferred time slot, email address, and any additional notes they wish to convey.
